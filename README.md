# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Coding, testing, and maintaining software that is both functional and secure requires a disciplined approach. By adopting secure coding practices (such as input validation checking), implementing comprehensive testing, keeping dependencies up-to-date, and maintaining a security-first mindset then over time, your software will remain reliable and secure by reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.  

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
In order to interpret user needs, I'd conduct stakeholder interviews, use survey questions, and create user stories to understand what the customer is looking for. These requirements are then incorporated and prioritized, and an initial prototype designed would be created and reviewed by the stakeholders to determine if the project is going in the right direction. I would also design using agile methodologies so the stakeholder is aware of the progress and make any changes they may require. In doing this while the project is being developed will ensure the final product meets the customer's needs.

# How do I approach designing software?

Designing software is a multifaceted process that requires careful planning, analysis, and execution. I would first engage with stakeholders to gather and understand functional and non-functional requirements. Based on the requirements, I would select an appropriate architectural style. This could be microservices, event-driven, or client-server or other architectural style depending on the requirements. Next I would choose the most appropriate programming language. For example, although Java is extremely popular at this time but it does have its downsides such as performance on large amounts of data. If performance was a key element I would consider using C++ because performance is one of its strengths. I would then start with a prototype of the software and have the stakeholder review it to make sure we are going in the right direction. Then continue with an agile deveopment methodology keepin the stakeholder informed of the progress and direction throughout the development of the product
